```
Command-line tool to stream logs from Logentries
```
This CLI tool helps you to query live logs from the command line and also search for a specific text on logentries.com.  The logentries portal has a start live tail button, however the browser update on the DOM was a bit slower than streaming on the command line. 

## Installation: 
```npm install -g logentries_reader_cli```

## Usage:

#### How to initialize the module ?
